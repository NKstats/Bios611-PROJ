## Substance dependence among people with TSRDs

This repository contains the analysis of data on mental health and substance 
use problems.You can replicate all the results presented, including figures and 
tables. The project is built using R, Python, Docker, and a Makefile to ensure 
smooth analysis. The instructions below will guide you through setting up the 
Docker container, installing necessary packages, and running the Makefile to 
reproduce the results.

### Downloading the raw data

The raw data files are not included in this repository due to their large size. 
To proceed with the analysis, you must download the necessary data files 
directly from the official source. Please follow these steps:

1. Visit the [SAMHSA (MH-CLD) website](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/mh-cld/datafiles).
2. Download the public use data files for the years 2013 to 2022. Be sure to 
select the **Delimited** file options.
3. Once downloaded, the files will be in ZIP format. Unzip the files and move 
the CSV files into the `data` folder in this repository.

This step is crucial for replicating the analysis in this repository.
